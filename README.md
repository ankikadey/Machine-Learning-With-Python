## Introduction

This repository contains two Python scripts for machine learning projects related to medical diagnosis and classification. The first script utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for the diagnosis of diabetes, while the second script employs a Keras model for the classification of Iris flowers.

## Diabetes Diagnosis using Naive Bayes

### Description

The diabetes diagnosis script (`Diabetes.py`) is designed to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not. It is implemented using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. The dataset used for training and testing is given.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Usage

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankikadey/Machine-Learning-With-Python.git
cd Machine-Learning-With-Python
cd Diabetes-Detection-Using-NB
```
